Running these programs requires python2-scipy and python2-matplotlib. To run the examples use:

python2 <program name>.py

The programs are:

DirichletNeumannAlogorithmComparison.py: plot the approximation gained from the dn algorithm along a global discretisation.

DiscretisationComparisonExample.py: plot a discrete approxmation of a diff equation along the correct solution.

DiscretisationExample.py: Simple program that shows how the discretisations are used

GetConvergenceRateDevation: prints the devations of the expected convergence rate for 4 different adaptive grids.
